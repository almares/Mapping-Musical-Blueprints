# Mapping-Musical-Blueprints
Music therapy has long been an effective form of treating stress and anxiety, as well as encouraging productivity and effort. However, access to a musical therapist can be extremely limited by either time or money, and individuals own bias can shade their view of what music is most effective. This application is intended to monitor the individual, determine for them the most effective music in a variety of scenarios, and automatically detect when an individual may need stress or anxiety reducing musical therapy. Our end goal intends to determine potentially effective music both by monitoring individual characteristics and, through proximity based networking, identifying the most intra-group specific qualities of the people you interact with the most and the locations you spend the most time in. Ultimately, we hope to provide a sort of music therapist and analyst of one’s own unique tonal blueprint, distinguishing the key factors that make an individual’s heart sing (and hopefully beat) and using this to eventually connect the musical blueprints of like-minded and impacted employers of sound.
